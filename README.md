# Jelly Shark

A premium Jellyfin client for tvOS and Apple Vision Pro that doesn't look like a Jellyfin client.

## What is Jelly Shark?

Jelly Shark brings professional-grade UI design to the open-source media server ecosystem. Built by someone who designed TV interfaces for Starz, it proves that open-source doesn't mean ugly or clunky.

Unlike existing Jellyfin clients that treat the interface as functional but forgettable, Jelly Shark makes the UI itself a feature—beautiful, configurable, and tailored to how you want to experience your media library.

## Key Features

### Genre-Inspired Themes
Visual languages that evoke the mood of what you're watching. Horror libraries get atmospheric dread, not corporate blue.

- **Standard**: Elegant, timeless Apple-quality baseline
- **Horror**: Blood reds and tension with angular typography
- **Action**: Kinetic energy with electric blues and sharp geometry
- **Video Store**: 90s Blockbuster nostalgia with warm, playful design

All themes support light and dark modes. Switch themes at runtime—no app restart required.

### Deep Customization
Component variants let you customize layouts while staying within your chosen theme's aesthetic. Mix and match: Horror theme with minimal cards, or Standard theme with detailed layouts.

### Platform-Native Excellence
Actually leverages tvOS and visionOS capabilities instead of just "running on" them:
- **tvOS**: Precise focus engine, intuitive remote gestures, Top Shelf integration, Siri support
- **visionOS**: Spatial layouts with meaningful depth, immersive viewing modes, natural hand/eye tracking

### Professional 10-Foot UI
Designed specifically for the lean-back, living room experience—not adapted from mobile.
